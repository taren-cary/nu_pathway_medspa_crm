## Supabase Functions

Create a Supabase Edge Function called `retell-webhook` to:
- Receive JSON payload from Retell AI.
- Check if Customer exists based on phone/email.
- If not, create new Customer.
- Then, insert Appointment linked to that Customer.

Create logic that maps the following incoming webhook variables to their proper places for each customer in the supabase database:
- `name` â†’ Customer Name
- `phoneNumber` â†’ Customer Phone
- `email` â†’ Customer Email
- `dateTime` â†’ Appointment Time
- `service` â†’ Service
- `notes` â†’ Any captured notes

Deploy the function and give me the webhook URL so that I can put it in Retell AI.

## CRM Frontend Pages
